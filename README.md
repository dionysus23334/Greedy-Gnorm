#Greedy-Gnorm: A Gradient Matrix Norm-Based Alternative to Attention Entropy for Head Pruning

## Getting Started

All experiments are implemented in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).

We recommend using **Python 3.9+**.

### Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n prune-test python=3.9 -y
conda activate prune-test
